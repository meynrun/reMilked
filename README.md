An unofficial cross-platform continuation of the **Milked** mod, updated for Minecraft 1.21.1 using the **Architectury API**.

## 🥛 Changes in this Version
This fork is not just a simple port; it introduces several mechanical improvements and fixes:

* **Multi-platform:** One codebase for both **Fabric** and **NeoForge** via Architectury API.
* **New Mechanics:** Added a milk regeneration mechanic (restores one level every 30 seconds).
   * Immortal players (Creative mode/Invulnerability) can no longer be milked.
   * Removed milking cooldown in Creative mode.
* **Bug Fixes:** Fixed an issue where armor could prevent death even after running out of milk.
* **Localization:** Added **Russian (ru_ru)** translation.
