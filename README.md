**reMilked** is an unofficial cross-platform continuation of the original **Milked** mod. Built with the **Architectury API**, it brings the unique "milking" mechanics to the modern versions of Minecraft.

## 🐄 About the Mod
Have you ever felt that players are... underutilized resources? **reMilked** allows players to be milked just like cows. Every player has a milk storage (10 levels max).

### Key Gameplay Mechanics:
* **Milking Players:** Use an empty bucket on another player to get a Milk Bucket.
* **The Risk:** Each milking action reduces the target's milk level. If a player's milk level reaches zero, they **die immediately**.
* **Self-Sustainability:** You can milk yourself! Just hold `Shift`, look down, and `Right-Click` with an empty bucket.
* **Regeneration:** Milk levels naturally restore over time (1 level every 30 seconds), so manage your "resources" wisely.

## ✨ Improvements in reMilked
This fork focuses on modernizing the experience and fixing long-standing issues:

* **Multi-platform Support:** Native support for both **Fabric** and **NeoForge**.
* **Refined Logic:** Immortal players (Creative mode or Invulnerability) can no longer be milked to death.
* **Creative Freedom:** Removed milking cooldowns for players in Creative mode.
* **Fixes:** Resolved a bug where armor could prevent death even after the player's milk supply was completely exhausted.
* **Localization:** Now includes full **Russian (ru_ru)** support.
